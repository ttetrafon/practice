# Python generators are used in cases where you need to be able to consume some data in a loop,
# but the size of the data set is potentially large enough to crash your program if you load it
# into memory. Generators allow the set of things to be iterated to be unbounded.

# Data sets like a yearâ€™s worth of access log entries from a high traffic website or the luminosity
# of stars visible through a light telescope are good candidates for a generator.
