# Meshes

## Import

- Drag and drop a mesh (fbx) into the _Content Drawer_ to import a mesh.
  - Select **Input Textures -> False** and **Material -> Material Input Method -> Do not create material**, as we will usually use materials already created in the project.
- Select the object and assign the default material(s).

## Nanite

The nanite system is dynamically changing the polygons of a static mesh for better visualisation depending on the distance from the camera.

To enable nanites on a static mesh, open its details, set **Nanite Settings -> Enable Nanite Support -> True**, and click **Apply Changes**.

Alternatively, right click on the static mesh within the content drawer, and select **Static Mesh Actions -> Nanite -> Enable**.
