# Meshes

## Import
* Drag and drop a mesh (fbx) into the *Content Drawer* to import a mesh.
  * Select **Input Textures -> False** and  **Material -> Material Input Method -> Do not create material**, as we will usually use materials already created in the project.
* Select the object and assign the default material(s).
