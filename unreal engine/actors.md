# Actors

## Types of Actors

### Pawn
* A pawn is an entity assigned to a player.
* Pawns react to input events.

## Spawning Actors During Gameplay
Stored actors can be spawned during gameplay.

Use the `Spawn Actor/AI From Class` blueprint nodes to do so.

## Nodes
* **Attach Actor to Component**: Attaches an actor to the referenced component in the *parent* input. Optionally, a *socket name* can be used to identify the place where the actor will be attached.
