# Assets

## Migration

Assets can be moved between projects.

- Open the source project.
- Select a folder/asset you want to migrate.
- Put them within the *content* folder of the target project.

## Level Instances / Assemblies

- A group of objects & actors can be combined into an assembly, which can then be inserted into other levels as a single actor.
- Level instances, when combined with nanite, can boost performance.
- Can be used in procedural generation workflows, especially with creating variants.
  - A good workflow with assemblies is to create a level with all all of a level instance's variants, so that they can be changed/adjusted in one place.
