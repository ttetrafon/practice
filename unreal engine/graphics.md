# Lighting

## Global Illumination

* **Ctrl+L** allows to manipulate the sunlight.

# Post Processing

* Post processing settings in a scene are controlled through the *PostProcessingVolume* object.
* A camera is affected only while it is within the post-process volume; a post-process volume does not cover the entire scene but only parts of it.

## Lens
### Exposure
* Metering Mode
  * **Auto Exposure** simulates the real life change of exposure of someone's eyes when lighting conditions change abruptly.

## Post Process Volume Settings
* **Infinite Extend (Unbound)** extends the volume so it can encompass the full scene at once, regardless of its size.
